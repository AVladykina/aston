## Branch aston_hw_1
### Overview for aston_hw_1
Task conditions:
* Implement your own ArrayList (not thread-safe). [Link to
description of the data structure](https://habr.com/en/articles/128269/)
* Implement the quicksort algorithm for your
implementation of ArrayList. [Link to an excellent description of how it works
algorithm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s-aG6yGGLU) Your QuickSort should take an ArrayList of any
type and sort it. Use:
  - Java generics
  - Comparable, Comparator
* Document the code. [What, why, and how](https://www.baeldung.com/javadoc)
  - All classes and interfaces must be documented at the class-level (class-level javadoc)
  - All public methods in your implementations shouldcontain javadoc
  - Documentation should be complete and provide a comprehensive and intuitive guide to using your code for another developer
* Cover the code with unit tests (use junit 5).
